This is a support component of [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/).

## Purpose

With this pallet, a chain built from substrate can join octopus network as an appchain.

An appchain can rent security from motherchain on demand.

## Overview of Octopus

Octopus Network is a host for Web3.0 applications in the form of independent blockchains, aka appchains. Octopus Network provides leased security, interoperability, infrastructure and many other useful and affordable services to appchains.

### Relay

Octopus Relay is a set of [smart contracts](https://github.com/octopus-network/octopus-relay-contract) running on NEAR blockchain, provides leased security to appchains, and make appchain interoperable with NEAR and other appchains.

### Appchain

Appchain is a Substrate-based blockchain that is building for a special decentralized web application. A Substrate-based blockchain could integrate the pallet [pallet-octopus-appchain](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain) as Octopus Appchain, and then [join the Octopus Network](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain/blob/master/docs/Appchain_Guide.md) to get flexible and affordable leased security, powerful out-of-box interoperability, and many useful infrastructures. 

### Validator

Octopus Validator provide security to a appchain by staking OCT token into Octopus Relay and [running a validator]() node for this appchain.

All validator nodes for one appchain will form a quorum to reach consensus on block production, they would be rewarded by appchain native token issuing, and malicious actors will be slashed with the staked OCT. By this mechanism, appchainâ€™s security is economically ensured by OCT staking in Octopus Relay.

## Appchain Guide

In this [tutorial](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain/blob/master/docs/Appchain_Guide.md) we will learn and practice how to connect Appchain to the Octopus network.
