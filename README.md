[![Released API docs](https://docs.rs/pallet-octopus-appchain/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/pallet-octopus-appchain)

This is a support component of [Octopus Network](https://oct.network/).

## Purpose

With this pallet, a chain built from substrate can join octopus network as an Appchain.

An Appchain can rent security from motherchain on demand.

## Overview of Octopus

Octopus Network is a host for Web3.0 applications in the form of independent blockchains, aka Appchains. Octopus Network provides leased security, interoperability, infrastructure and many other useful and affordable services to Appchains.

### Relay

Octopus Relay is a set of [smart contracts](https://github.com/octopus-network/octopus-relay-contract) running on the NEAR blockchain. It provides leased security to Appchains, and make Appchains interoperable with NEAR and other Appchains.

### Appchain

An Appchain is a Substrate-based blockchain that is made for a specific decentralized web application. A Substrate-based blockchain could integrate the pallet [pallet-octopus-appchain](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain) as an Octopus Appchain, and  [join the Octopus Network](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain/blob/master/docs/Appchain_Guide.md) get flexible and affordable leased security, powerful out-of-the-box interoperability, and many useful infrastructures. 

### Validator

Octopus Validators provide security to a Appchain by staking OCT tokens on Octopus Relay and [running validator]() nodes for this Appchain.

All validator nodes for one Appchain will form a quorum to reach consensus on block production. They will be rewarded by Appchain native token issuing, and malicious actors will be slashed with the staked OCT. By this mechanism, an Appchainâ€™s security is economically ensured by OCT staking on the Octopus Relay.

## Appchain Guide

In this [tutorial](https://github.com/octopus-network/pallet-octopus-appchain/blob/master/docs/Appchain_Guide.md) we will learn and practice how to connect an Appchain to the Octopus network.
